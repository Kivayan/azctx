# Specification Quality Checklist: Azure CLI Account Context Switcher

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: October 17, 2025
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

All checklist items passed successfully. The specification is complete and ready for the planning phase.

### Detailed Review

**Content Quality**: ✅ PASSED

- Specification focuses on WHAT and WHY, not HOW
- No mention of programming languages, frameworks, or technical implementation
- Written in business-friendly language describing user needs and workflows
- All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete

**Requirement Completeness**: ✅ PASSED

- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present
- All 19 functional requirements are specific and testable (e.g., "System MUST provide a command to add the current Azure CLI context")
- Success criteria include specific measurable metrics (e.g., "under 5 seconds", "50+ contexts", "100% of valid contexts")
- Success criteria are technology-agnostic focusing on user experience ("Users can switch between Azure contexts" not "API responds in X ms")
- All 5 user stories have detailed acceptance scenarios with Given/When/Then format
- 7 edge cases identified covering various failure and boundary conditions
- Scope section clearly defines what's included and excluded
- Dependencies (Azure CLI, valid accounts) and assumptions (local storage, terminal capabilities) are documented

**Feature Readiness**: ✅ PASSED

- Each functional requirement maps to user stories and acceptance scenarios
- User stories prioritized (P1-P5) and cover all core workflows (switch, add, status, list, delete)
- Success criteria are measurable and user-focused (time to complete tasks, number of keystrokes, error clarity)
- Specification maintains strict separation between requirements (what) and implementation (how)

## Notes

The specification is production-ready and meets all quality standards. No additional clarifications needed. Ready to proceed with `/speckit.plan` command.
