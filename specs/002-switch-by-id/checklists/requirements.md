# Specification Quality Checklist: Direct Context Switching by ID

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: October 23, 2025
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality - PASS ✓

- **No implementation details**: Specification focuses on "WHAT" (user needs) without mentioning specific code, frameworks, or implementation approaches
- **User value focused**: Each user story clearly articulates business value and user benefits
- **Non-technical language**: Written in plain language accessible to stakeholders (e.g., "switch directly," "case-sensitive matching")
- **All mandatory sections**: User Scenarios, Requirements, and Success Criteria are all complete

### Requirement Completeness - PASS ✓

- **No clarification markers**: All requirements are concrete and specific
- **Testable requirements**: Each functional requirement can be verified (e.g., FR-001: "System MUST support `--id` flag" - testable by running command)
- **Measurable success criteria**: All criteria include specific metrics (e.g., SC-001: "under 2 seconds")
- **Technology-agnostic criteria**: Success criteria describe user-facing outcomes without implementation details
- **Acceptance scenarios**: Each user story includes complete Given-When-Then scenarios
- **Edge cases**: 7 edge cases identified covering parameter handling, concurrent operations, and error scenarios
- **Clear scope**: Feature is bounded to adding `--id`/`-i` parameter to existing switch command
- **Dependencies**: Assumptions section clearly states dependencies on existing features

### Feature Readiness - PASS ✓

- **Clear acceptance criteria**: Each functional requirement is unambiguous and verifiable
- **Primary flows covered**: 3 prioritized user stories cover: direct switching (P1), case-sensitivity (P2), error handling (P3)
- **Measurable outcomes**: 6 success criteria provide concrete metrics for feature validation
- **No implementation leakage**: Specification maintains focus on user needs throughout

## Notes

✅ **Specification is ready for planning phase (`/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`)**

All checklist items pass validation. The specification is:

- Complete with all mandatory sections
- Clear and unambiguous
- Testable with concrete acceptance criteria
- Free of implementation details
- Ready for development planning

No updates required before proceeding to next phase.
